            1.Grind onion, green chilli, ginger and garlic together in the small chutney jar of a grinder to make medium coarse paste. Grind the tomatoes to make tomato puree. Grind cashew nuts with 2 tablespoons water until smooth paste.


            2.Heat 2 tablespoons oil in the same pan/kadai over medium flame. Add crushed onion paste (prepared in step-1) and salt (only for onion paste, it helps to cook onion faster). Saut√© it until oil starts to separate or it turns translucent. It will take around 5-7 minutes.


            3.Add tomato puree (prepared in step-1) and cook on medium flame until oil starts to separate, for approx. 5-6 minutes.


            4.Add red chilli powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, garam masala powder and salt.


            5.Stir and cook for a minute. Add cashew nut paste (prepared in step-1).


            6.Stir and cook for 1-2 minutes.


            7.Add boiled peas and 1/2 cup water; mix properly and cook for 2-3 minutes.


            8.Add paneer cubes and cook for 2-3 minutes. We have added plain paneer cubes but you can add shallow fried paneer to enhance the flavor (see tips).


            9.Turn off flame and transfer prepared curry to a serving bowl. Matar paneer is ready. Serve it with butter kulcha, cucumber tomato onion salad and gajar halwa for a complete meal.
